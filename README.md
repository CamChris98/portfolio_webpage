# Overview

This website was written and made interactive using the React.js framework. 

The purpose of writing this website was to showcase an understanding and implementation of the react framework, and to give a more polished look to my portfolio.

# Web Pages
The web page that i created is the portfolio webpage, it has the buttons to display the information of each project in the portfolio 
and only displays the information if the user clicks on the button. 

# Development Environment

I wrote this program using the JavaScript language and the react framework on the VScode application on my mac computer. i also had to download node.js and along with it npm to create the webapp. 

I also wrote a little css code to go along with the page.
